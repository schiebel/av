This is a MODIFIED version of aipsview which was developed by the
Radio Synthesis Imaging at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) as part of their collaboration with the former
AIPS++ project (now reorganized as CASA, http://casa.nrao.edu).

For now, the only modifications are for the purposes of compilation
independent of AIPS++.
